# Personal Finance Report

### Background
As I look to start properly budgeting and diversifying my investments, it occurred to me that there's none more suited to the task than myself - a career analyst with a brand new qualification in Power BI. So, I set myself a task of creating a personal finance report.

### Goal
Analyse outgoings data pulled from my monthly online banking statements. 
##### Questions
* What are the regular outgoings that are consistently occuring at same time every month?
* What outgoings seem erroneous, that could potentially be marked for cut-down?
* What is the remainder of my income after regular/consistent payments have been completed?
* When savings are calculated and taken into account, what return can I expect to see out of them over the course of a calendar year?

##### Tools
* Microsoft Power BI
